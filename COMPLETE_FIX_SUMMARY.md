## 🚨 **CRITICAL STEP: Railway Environment Variable**

The admin panel is deployed on Railway and **MUST** have the correct environment variable set:

### **URGENT: Set Environment Variable on Railway**

1. **Go to**: [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. **Find your project**: `easyearn-adminpanel-production`
3. **Click on your admin panel service**
4. **Go to**: `Variables` tab
5. **Add Environment Variable**:
   ```
   Key: NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL
   Value: https://easyearn-backend-production-01ac.up.railway.app
   ```
6. **Save** and wait for automatic redeploy

### **Alternative: Manual Redeploy**
If automatic redeploy doesn't happen:
1. Go to `Deployments` tab
2. Click `Redeploy` on latest deployment

---

## 🧪 **VERIFICATION**

After Railway deployment with environment variable:

### **1. Check Admin Panel Dashboard**
- Visit: `https://easyearn-adminpanel-production.up.railway.app`
- Dashboard should load statistics
- No 404 errors in browser console

### **2. Test Backend Connectivity**
```bash
curl https://easyearn-backend-production-01ac.up.railway.app/api/admin/dashboard-stats
```
Should return 200 status with JSON data.

### **3. Browser Console Check**
- Open browser developer tools
- Should see successful API calls to `easyearn-backend-production-01ac.up.railway.app`
- No more `nexusbackend-production` errors

---

## 📋 **EXPECTED RESULTS**

After complete fix:
- ✅ Dashboard loads with real statistics
- ✅ User list shows actual users
- ✅ Deposit requests work properly
- ✅ All admin functionality operational
- ✅ No more 404 API errors

---

## 🆘 **IF STILL NOT WORKING**

1. **Check Railway Environment Variable** is set correctly
2. **Verify Railway Deployment** completed successfully
3. **Check Browser Console** for any remaining errors
4. **Force Refresh** browser cache (Ctrl+F5)

## 📞 **STATUS CHECK**

Current Status:
- ✅ Code fixes: **COMPLETE**
- ✅ GitHub push: **COMPLETE**
- ⚠️ Railway environment variable: **NEEDS TO BE SET**
- ⚠️ Railway redeploy: **NEEDS TO HAPPEN**

**Once Railway environment variable is set, the admin panel will be fully functional!**
