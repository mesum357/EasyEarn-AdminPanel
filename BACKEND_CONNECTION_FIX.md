# Admin Panel Backend Connection Fix

## Issue
The admin panel was not connecting to the backend properly because it was using incorrect API URLs.

## Problem Details
- **Incorrect Backend URL**: The admin panel components were using `https://nexusbackend-production.up.railway.app` 
- **Correct Backend URL**: Should use `https://easyearn-backend-production-01ac.up.railway.app`
- **Some components**: Were also using `http://localhost:3005` which is incorrect for production

## Files Fixed
The following admin panel components were updated with the correct backend URL:

1. **Dashboard** (`components/pages/dashboard.tsx`)
   - Fixed dashboard stats API call

2. **User List** (`components/pages/user-list.tsx`)
   - Fixed users API call

3. **Task Management** (`components/pages/task-management.tsx`)
   - Fixed tasks API calls
   - Fixed task submissions API calls
   - Fixed task creation/update/delete API calls

4. **Deposit Requests** (`components/pages/deposit-requests.tsx`)
   - Fixed deposit fetch API call
   - Fixed deposit approval/rejection API calls

5. **Withdraw Requests** (`components/pages/withdraw-requests.tsx`)
   - Fixed withdrawal requests API call
   - Fixed withdrawal processing API call

6. **User Notifications** (`components/pages/user-notifications.tsx`)
   - Fixed notifications fetch API call
   - Fixed users fetch API call
   - Fixed notification creation API call

## Environment Configuration
Created environment files with the correct backend URL:

- `.env.production` - For production builds
- `.env.local` - For local development

Both files contain:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://easyearn-backend-production-01ac.up.railway.app
```

## Backend API Verification
Tested the following endpoints and confirmed they're working:

✅ `GET /api/admin/dashboard-stats` - Returns dashboard statistics
✅ `GET /api/admin/users` - Returns user list
✅ `GET /api/admin/deposits` - Returns deposit requests
✅ All other admin endpoints are accessible

## How to Deploy

1. **Build the admin panel:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Start the production server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **Or for development:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Verification
The admin panel should now:
- Load dashboard statistics successfully
- Display user lists
- Show deposit and withdrawal requests
- Allow sending notifications
- Connect to all backend API endpoints properly

All API calls now use the correct backend URL: `https://easyearn-backend-production-01ac.up.railway.app`
